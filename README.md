I’m @MattEvanoff

I am a Software engineer living in Asheville, NC.

I have been doing web development for over a decade for a number of companies both large and small.

I have extensive experience in React, Vue, AngularJS, jQuery, javascript, etc...

I mostly do front-end development - though these days, the line between FE and BE is getting more and more blurry...

You can see some of my stuff here on github - though it's probably not super exciting.

I also have a website which is updated every few years: http://www.mattevanoff.com/ - also probably not super exciting.

Currently I'm working in React profesionally, and exploring the T3 Stack personally.  I really enjoy Vue, but have really warmed up to React in the last couple years.

You can connect with me on LinkedIn here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattevanoff/

If you want to contact me...I'm sure you can figure out how.
